## Description
ExtendableArray is an array of integers class, which supports some functionalities. ExtendableArray is an infinite length array initialized to all zeros. In our case, default ExtendableArray constructor allocate memory space to hold 2 integers. It is expandable and consider the cases when operator located on the right side and on the left side. So, if we assign to the element of the array that hasnâ€™t been allocated yet, it transparently reallocates the memory space. If the index to operator [] used on the right side of an assignment operation is outside the currently allocated space, the operation returns 0 without reallocating more memory space.
