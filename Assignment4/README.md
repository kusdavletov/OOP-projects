## Description
A poker deck contains 52 cards. Each card has a suit of either clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades (denoted C, D, H, S in the input data). Each card also has a value of either 2 through 10, jack, queen, king, or ace (denoted 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A). For scoring purposes card values are ordered as above, with 2 having the lowest and ace the highest value. The suit has no impact on value. A poker hand consists of five cards dealt from the deck. Poker hands are ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest.
The program reads the input 5 cards for each hand as strings. Then, convert them into numbers and determine the type of cards combination. After, it checks which hand has better combination, and if they are same compares by highest cards.
